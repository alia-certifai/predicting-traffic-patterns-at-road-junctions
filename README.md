# Predicting Traffic Patterns at Road Junctions

<!--- ![alt text](https://alpinesherpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/traffic-header.jpg) --->

## Description
###### In this project, we are predicting traffic patterns in each of these four junctions for the next 4 months. The dataset was taken from [Kaggle.com | Time Series in IOT (Internet of Things)](https://www.kaggle.com/vetrirah/ml-iot?select=train_ML_IOT.csv)

###### This project aims to build a reliable traffic behaviour forecasting model that can be incorporated into a smart traffic light system to alleviate congestions at intersections.

## Installation
### Streamlit run on localhost

##### 1. Install dependecies
* $ pip install streamlit
* $ pip install matplotlib
* $ pip install statsmodels
* $ pip install torch
* $ pip install plotly
* $ pip install seaborn
* $ pip install pandas
* $ pip install numpy
* $ pip install scikit_learn
* $ pip install torchsummaryX

##### 2. Get the application files (main.py), (data_module.py), (deep_learning_module.py), image file (traffic-header.jpg) and dataset file (train_ML_IOT.csv) in one folder
##### 3. Open command prompt and run
* $streamlit run main.py
  

## Usage
##### 1. Download/clone the entire github repository
* This repository consists of multiple forecasting ways to predict traffic patterns in each of the four junctions for the next 4 months. The best model can be found in the notebook LSTM Multi-Uni_Multistep Traffic Analysis.
* Install the required dependencies based on the Installation instructions above.

##### 2. Run main.py in terminal to showcase Streamlit running in localhost.
